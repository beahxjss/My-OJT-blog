                <p class="about-description">
                    My on-the-job training at the Information Communications Technology Office (ICTO)
                    was a great experience that helped me grow as a person and as a professional. It provided
                    me a chance to use what I learned in school in a real job, where I learned how to follow 
                    industry standards, work with professionals, and take on more responsibility. I learned a 
                    lot about how an IT department works and improved my problem-solving, time management, and 
                    communication abilities. Overall, the event helped me see my career path more clearly and 
                    made me more sure that I want to work in computer science.

                                On the first day of our On-the-Job Training (OJT), we officially reported to the office
                            and began the onboarding process. One of the first things we did was enter our biometrics
                            into the office's Daily Time Record (DTR) system. We were told to use this system every 
                            day to check in and out and keep track of our hours worked. It was our first time working 
                            in a real office, and it was both exciting and nerve-racking because everything was new.
                                After we finished the first tasks, we met our mentors. They called all the trainees
                            together for a short discussion to explain everything. They talked about the company's 
                            rules, what was expected of us, and what projects we would be working on in general 
                            throughout this meeting. They also stressed how important it was to be professional, on 
                            time, and always learning during our training. It was a terrific way to get things started. 
                                After the group meeting, we were each given a mentor who would watch over us 
                            and help us during the program. I was given to Sir Kiel, who works in the IT department 
                            as a developer. He asked me about my existing skills and the technology I was already 
                            familiar with during our first one-on-one conversation. He asked me directly if I had ever
                            worked with Laravel, which is a PHP-based web framework. I told him the truth: I had only 
                            seen it a tiny bit before, largely in school assignments and on my own. 
                                He then told me to start by learning the foundations and more complex parts of 
                            Laravel, with a focus on Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), which is Laravel's 
                            built-in way to talk to the database. He said that it is very important to grasp Eloquent 
                            because it is used for much of the company's backend development work.
                                He gave me several web resources, documentation, and example projects that I 
                            could use as guides. He also told me to write things down, try making simple models, and 
                            play around with relationships in an example Laravel app, like one-to-many and many-to-
                            many. I spent the remainder of the week working through the stuff he sent me, watching 
                            videos, and trying out other Laravel features, such as migrations, seeders, controllers, 
                            and basic routing. 
                                At first, it was hard, but I was excited because I knew that this hands-on learning
                            experience will help me grow as a developer. I liked how helpful Sir Kiel was and how he 
                            always took the time to answer my queries about the ideas. By the conclusion of the week,
                            I had a better idea of how Laravel organizes its apps and how Eloquent makes it easier to
                            work with databases.

                                I felt more at ease and familiar with the work atmosphere and expectations as I 
                            started my second week of On-the-Job Training (OJT). I was anxious to start using what 
                            I had learned after spending most of the first week learning the basics of Laravel and 
                            the ideas behind Eloquent ORM. This week, I stopped thinking about theory and started 
                            developing code and testing different parts of the Laravel framework on my own. 
                                I went back over the notes I had made from the tutorials and documentation I read
                            in Week 1 as one of the first things I did. I made a little example Laravel project so 
                            I could try out what I had learnt, such as how to make models, migrations, and controllers, 
                            and how to set up associations between tables. I used Laravel's migration system to practice 
                            designing database structures. It made it easy to set up tables and fields while keeping 
                            the code clean and easy to read. 
                                I also tried to use Eloquent to set up one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. 
                            For instance, I made a simple structure with users and posts, where one person might 
                            have more than one post. When I tried to get data using Eloquent methods, I ran across 
                            a few problems, especially when it comes to chaining searches or getting to related 
                            models through relationships. There were instances when the output wasn't what I 
                            expected, and there were other times when I got errors that I didn't understand right 
                            away. But instead of giving up, I saw these as chances to learn more. When I had a 
                            problem or a glitch, I always looked it up online, read the Laravel documentation, 
                            and asked inquiries when I needed to. Debugging took up a lot of my time during the 
                            week. I learned how to use Laravel's error messages better.
                                This week, one thing that really struck me out was how crucial it is to pay attention
                            to the small things when working with code. A single typo, a missing semicolon, or a 
                            variable with the wrong name could cause the whole program to stop working. I started 
                            to understand how important it is to write code that is easy to read and follow best 
                            practices all the time so that things don't get too complicated later on.

                                As I entered my third week of On-the-Job Training (OJT), I was assigned my first 
                            real development task within the project I had been learning about. It was both exhilarating 
                            and hard because it required putting all I had learned so far into a real system with real 
                            users. The project I was working on was a Clientele Satisfaction Survey Management System. 
                            It's a web-based platform that an institution uses to get feedback from clients or students 
                            to see how well different departments are doing. The system figures out what the data means 
                            and then gives the results to the heads of departments so they can keep an eye on and enhance 
                            their services. 
                                My job was to improve the system's filtering depending on dates that users set. 
                            The way the system is set up now only lets you see survey data once a year, which makes 
                            it less flexible. Users, especially department heads, couldn't narrow down the data to 
                            certain months or period ranges. For example, the system couldn't let them examine input 
                            from just November or a certain week in a semester. 
                                To fix this, I had to make a custom date range filter that let users choose their own 
                            start and end dates. The system should therefore only show the data that falls inside that 
                            range on the survey results table. This tool would give administrators more control and 
                            accuracy when looking at performance reviews over time. 
                                I started by looking at the code that was already there, figuring out where the 
                            current filter logic was, and then figuring out where changes needed to be made. I 
                            designed the new logic to replace the default year-based filter with a dynamic one that 
                            could accommodate different date inputs. I also looked into how the frontend (particularly
                            the date picker component) would send data to the backend and how to change the 
                            controller's query to work with custom ranges. 
                                I ran into a lot of problems when doing this. Some of the problems had to do with 
                            how the date input was collected and sent along with the request. There were also issues
                            with formatting and filtering the database query so that it gave the relevant results. 
                            Sometimes, the table didn't show any results or showed the wrong data. I spent time 
                            fixing these problems by thoroughly reviewing the Laravel controller, Laravel livewire, 
                            and Eloquent queries. I also made sure that the date formats matched what was in the database. 
                                Because this was a live system with significant data, I had to be extra careful with 
                            every modification I made. I wrote down everything I did and talked to my mentor, Sir Kiel, 
                            every time I ran into a tough difficulty. He showed me the best ways to debug, specifically 
                            how to examine request inputs and query responses. I also used Laravel's built-in debugging 
                            tools to find problems more quickly. 
                                Even though it was hard, this exercise helped me grasp much better how to connect user 
                            inputs on the front end with logic on the back end of a Laravel project. It also helped me 
                            get better at working with databases, especially writing conditional queries with Eloquent. 
                            I wasn't able to finish the whole feature in Week 3 since I was having some problems, but I 
                            made a lot of progress and got ready to finish it the next week.

                                I was still working on the same assignment in my fourth week of On-the-Job 
                            Training (OJT) that I had started in Week 3. This task was to add a date range filter to the 
                            Clientele Survey Management System. This week was all about fixing bugs and finishing
                            the feature after days of looking at the codebase, playing with logic, and figuring out what
                            was wrong that caused errors or incomplete functionality. 
                                The idea was to let department heads sift survey data by any date range they 
                            wanted, instead of just being able to see it once a year. This was especially helpful for
                            keeping an eye on performance during certain months, events, or review periods. Last 
                            week, I had already developed the main framework, but there were still errors and 
                            problems with how the data was being retrieved and shown. 
                                At the beginning of the week, I worked on fixing bugs in both the front-end and 
                            back-end logic. I looked closely at how the date range data were sent from the user 
                            interface to the controller and then how the Eloquent query worked on them. I also 
                            looked at edge scenarios, such as when the start date was after the end date or when 
                            there was no data in the chosen range. These aspects were vital to make sure that the
                            user experience was smooth and free of mistakes. 
                                One problem I had was figuring out how Laravel handled date formats, especially 
                            when I was comparing them to the format in the database. Before I could utilize the dates 
                            in the query criteria, I had to use Laravel's Carbon library to parse and transform them all 
                            in the same way. There were also times when the table didn't show the results correctly, so I 
                            had to change how the data was sent to the view and presented dynamically.
                                After a few rounds of testing and making changes, I eventually got the new 
                            interface to work well by the middle of the week. Now, admins could choose a start 
                            and finish date, fill out the form, and see only the survey results that fell inside that range 
                            right away. 
                                After the functionality was working as it should, I tested it again with other types of 
                            data and went over the improvements with my mentor, Sir Kiel. He liked how it worked 
                            and suggested some changes to the user interface to make the date range selector easier 
                            to use. I made some little changes to the layout to make it look more user-friendly while 
                            still keeping it in line with the rest of the system's design. 
                                It was great to get to this point. It was my first time implementing a full feature in a 
                            live system, from figuring out what was needed to writing the code, fixing bugs, and 
                            presenting a working solution. I was really proud of myself for knowing that my work would 
                            assist real users and analyze vital survey data more quickly.

                            In the fifth week of my On-the-Job Training, I was assigned a brand-new task 
                        that helped me learn and grow even more. My mentor told me about APIs (Application 
                        Programming Interfaces) and how important it would be for me to grasp how they function, 
                        especially in the Laravel framework, for the next big job I would have to do. Before I 
                        started coding, I was told to spend the week learning how Laravel APIs are structured, 
                        used, and consumed. This would offer me the basic information I needed to do well in the 
                        following part of my training. 
                            I began by learning about APIs and how important they are to current web apps. I 
                        found out that APIs are like bridges between different software systems that let them talk
                        to each other and share data in a safe and standard way. When I learned about Laravel, 
                        I found out that establishing APIs means making routes, controllers, and models that send
                        data back in formats like JSON. This data can then be used by front-end apps, mobile apps, 
                        or other systems outside of Laravel. 
                            One of the most significant things I learnt this week was how to tell the difference 
                        between web routes and API routes in Laravel. The routes/api.php file usually has the API 
                        routes in it. These routes are stateless, which means they don't use sessions or cookies. 
                        This makes them perfect for apps that are current and separate from each other. I 
                        practiced making basic API endpoints for typical tasks including getting data (GET), 
                        sending data (POST), changing existing records (PUT/PATCH), and deleting entries 
                        (DELETE). I immediately learned how crucial it is to know the HTTP protocol when 
                        working with APIs because each method has its own syntax and structure. 
                            I used Postman, a popular tool for performing HTTP queries and seeing 
                        responses, to test the API endpoints I was making. It let me try out different situations, 
                        evaluate how my routes worked, and watch how the server handled each kind of request. 
                        This hands-on experience made me feel more at ease with fixing problems with how 
                        requests are handled, status codes, and formatting responses. 
                            As I learned more, I also learned about more sophisticated topics, such how to 
                        utilize middleware to protect API routes, especially for users who are logged in. I looked 
                        into Laravel's built-in authentication tools, such as API tokens and sanctum, which are 
                        typically used to keep sensitive data safe and make sure that only authorized users can 
                        go to specified endpoints. I learned how to use resource classes to make sure that the 
                        API replies are always structured the same way. This helps keep the code clean and easy 
                        to read. 
                            I took a lot of notes, read the official Laravel docs, and watched a lot of tutorials to 
                        make sure I understood everything better. I even tried making a little feature that used an 
                        API and a fake dataset from scratch to see whether I could use what I had learnt in a real-world 
                        situation. I also talked to my mentor a lot, and he was incredibly helpful in answering my 
                        concerns and making the more technical portions of the process clearer.

                            In Week 6 of my On-the-Job Training, I finally got to use what I had learned about 
                        Laravel APIs the week before. I started working on the actual implementation of the API 
                        endpoints needed for the system I was given to develop when I had a good understanding 
                        of API ideas. This was a big stride in my growth because I went from studying and trying 
                        things out to making genuine, working parts for a live project. 
                            I had to make a collection of API services that would let the system do different 
                        things with data, such getting all records, looking at individual entries, deleting objects, 
                        and maybe even updating data in the future. I began by creating the necessary API routes 
                        in the routes/api.php file, making sure to thoroughly outline the layout for each endpoint. 
                        I made sure that each route followed RESTful rules, which meant using GET to see data, 
                        DELETE to delete data, and so on. 
                            The index endpoint was the first resource I made. It gets a list of all the relevant 
                        entries and returns it. I was able to get the data from the database and send it back as a 
                        JSON response using Laravel's Eloquent ORM. I used API Resource classes to change and 
                        format the answer so that it was clean, consistent, and ready for the frontend or other 
                        systems to use. 
                            Next, I set up the show endpoint, which lets the API return a specific item by its ID. 
                        This was helpful for looking at the full details of a single survey or response. I also dealt 
                        with error messages, like sending back a "Not Found" message if the item you asked for 
                        didn't exist. This phase of the process taught me how important it is to handle errors 
                        correctly and send back HTTP status codes that make sense. 
                            The destroy endpoint was another important aspect of the API I worked on. It lets 
                        you delete certain records. I made sure to include checks before deleting to make sure 
                        that only valid and existing records may be deleted. I also added the right success and 
                        error messages to the JSON answers so that anyone is using the API knows what's going on. 
                            I used Postman to test each endpoint exhaustively as I worked on them. I not only 
                        tested to see if the answers were right, but I also looked at how the API worked in different 
                        situations. This helped me find and fix faults early on, like problems with processing IDs, 
                        null data, or formatting difficulties in the output. I also worked on making the API more 
                        useful and secure by using Laravel's built-in capabilities, such as route model binding, 
                        resource collections, and request validation. 
                            It was incredibly satisfying to see how everything I had learned that week, from 
                        routing and controllers to formatting resources and testing, worked together in a real-
                        world situation. I started to see how APIs are important for linking different parts of a 
                        system and how important it is to keep the code clear, consistent, and able to handle 
                        errors.
